                                "Embed Generator is a powerful tool that enables you to create visually appealing and interactive embed messages for your Discord server. With the use of webhooks, Embed Generator allows you to customize the appearance of your messages and make them more engaging.\n\nTo get started, all you need is a webhook URL, which can be obtained from the 'Integrations' tab in your server's settings. If you encounter any issues while setting up a webhook, our bot can assist you in creating one.\n\nInstead of using webhooks you can also select a server and channel directly here on the website. The bot will automatically create a webhook for you and use it to send the message.",
